**Automata**

**Description:**

Automata is an end-of-year project developed during the 2021/2022 academic year at ENSI (Engineering School). Created in collaboration with my classmate Akrem Ben Mbarek, Automata is an interactive application designed to build finite automata based on user preferences. The app allows users to visualize the automata's graph and verify whether it accepts a given word or not.

**Key Features:**

- **Finite Automata Construction:** Build finite automata by specifying states, transitions, and accepting states using an intuitive user interface.

- **Graph Visualization:** Visualize the constructed finite automata's graph to gain a better understanding of its structure and behavior.

- **Word Acceptance Verification:** Test the automata by inputting words and checking if it accepts or rejects them.

**How to Use:**

1. Download the project files from this GitHub repository

2. Install the required dependencies and set up the development environment.

3. Launch the Automata app and start building your finite automata.
